# Define type of comment characters to apply based on file extensions.
comments:
  # The extensions (or singular extension) field defines which file
  # extensions to apply the commenter to.
  - extensions:
      - js
      - rs
      - go
    # The commenter field defines the kind of commenter to
    # generate. There are two types of commenters: line and block.
    #
    # This demonstrates a line commenter configuration. A line
    # commenter type will apply the comment_char to the beginning of
    # each line in the license header. It will then apply a number of
    # empty newlines to the end of the header equal to trailing_lines.
    #
    # If trailing_lines is omitted it is assumed to be 0.
    commenter:
      type: line

  - extensions:
      - css
      - cpp
      - c
    # This demonstrates a block commenter configuration. A block
    # commenter type will add start_block_char as the first character
    # in the license header and add end_block_char as the last character
    # in the license header. If per_line_char is provided each line of
    # the header between the block start and end characters will be
    # line commented with the per_line_char
    #
    # trailing_lines works the same for both block and line commenter
    # types

  # The extension string "any" is special and so will match any file
  # extensions. Commenter configurations are always checked in the
  # order they are defined, so if any is used it should be the last
  # commenter configuration or else it will override all others.
  #
  # In this configuration if we can't match the file extension we fall
  # back to the popular '#' line comment used in most scripting
  # languages.
