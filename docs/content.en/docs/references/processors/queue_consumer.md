# queue_consumer

## Description

The queue_consumer processor is used to asynchronously consume requests in a queue and send the requests to Elasticsearch.

## Configuration Example

A simple example is as follows:

```
pipeline:
- name: bulk_request_ingest
  auto_start: true
  keep_running: true
  processor:
    - queue_consumer:
        input_queue: "backup"
        elasticsearch: "backup"
        waiting_after: [ "backup_failure_requests"]
        worker_size: 20
        when:
          cluster_available: [ "backup" ]
```
