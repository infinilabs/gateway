# indexing_merge

## Description

The indexing_merge processor is used to consume pure JSON documents in the queue, and merge them into bulk requests and save them in the specified queue.
It needs to be consumed with the `bulk_indexing` processor, and batch writes are used instead of single requests to improve write throughput.

## Configuration Example

A simple example is as follows:

```
pipeline:
  - name: indexing_merge
    auto_start: true
    keep_running: true
    processor:
      - indexing_merge:
          input_queue: "request_logging"
          elasticsearch: "logging-server"
          index_name: "infini_gateway_requests"
          output_queue:
            name: "gateway_requests"
            label:
              tag: "request_logging"
          worker_size: 1
          bulk_size_in_mb: 10
  - name: logging_requests
    auto_start: true
    keep_running: true
    processor:
      - bulk_indexing:
          bulk:
            compress: true
            batch_size_in_mb: 10
            batch_size_in_docs: 5000
          consumer:
            fetch_max_messages: 100
          queues:
            type: indexing_merge
          when:
            cluster_available: [ "logging-server" ]
```
