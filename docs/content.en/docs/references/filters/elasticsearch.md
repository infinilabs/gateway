# elasticsearch

## Description

The elasticsearch filter is used to forward requests to back-end Elasticsearch clusters.

## Configuration Example

Before using the elasticsearch filter, define one Elasticsearch cluster configuration node as follows:

```
elasticsearch:
- name: prod
  enabled: true
  endpoint: http://192.168.3.201:9200
```

The following shows a flow configuration example.

```
flow:
  - name: cache_first
    filter:
      - elasticsearch:
          elasticsearch: prod
```

The preceding example forwards requests to the `prod` cluster.

## Automatic Update

For a large cluster that contains many nodes, it is almost impossible to configure all back-end nodes individually. Instead, you only need to enable auto-discovery of back-end nodes on the Elasticsearch module. See the following example.

```
elasticsearch:
- name: prod
  enabled: true
  endpoint: http://192.168.3.201:9200
  discovery:
    enabled: true
    refresh:
      enabled: true
  basic_auth:
    username: elastic
    password: pass
```

Then, enable automatic configuration refresh on the filter. Now, all back-end nodes can be accessed and the status of online and offline nodes is automatically updated. See the following example.

```
flow:
  - name: cache_first
    filter:
      - elasticsearch:
          elasticsearch: prod
          refresh:
            enabled: true
            interval: 30s
```

## Setting the Weight

If there are many back-end clusters, INFINI Gateway allows you to set different access weights for different nodes. See the following configuration example.

```
flow:
  - name: cache_first
    filter:
      - elasticsearch:
          elasticsearch: prod
          balancer: weight
          refresh:
            enabled: true
            interval: 30s
          weights:
            - host: 192.168.3.201:9200
              weight: 10
            - host: 192.168.3.202:9200
              weight: 20
            - host: 192.168.3.203:9200
              weight: 30
```

In the above example, the traffic destined for an Elasticsearch cluster is distributed to the `203`, `202`, and `201` nodes at a ratio of `3：2：1`.

## Filtering Node

INFINI Gateway can also filter requests based on node IP address, label, or role to avoid sending requests to specific nodes, such as the master and cold nodes. See the following configuration example.

```
flow:
  - name: cache_first
    filter:
      - elasticsearch:
          elasticsearch: prod
          balancer: weight
          refresh:
            enabled: true
            interval: 30s
          filter:
            hosts:
              exclude:
                - 192.168.3.201:9200
              include:
                - 192.168.3.202:9200
                - 192.168.3.203:9200
            tags:
              exclude:
                - temp: cold
              include:
                - disk: ssd
            roles:
              exclude:
                - master
              include:
                - data
                - ingest
```
