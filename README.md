ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Youâ€™ve found the ultimate gateway solution for Elasticsearch or OpenSearch! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥


INFINI Gateway is a high performance gateway for Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. It offers a broad range of features and is easy to use. INFINI Gateway works in the same way as a common reverse proxy. It is usually deployed in front of clusters. All requests are sent to the gateway instead of server, and then the gateway forwards the requests to the back-end clusters. The gateway is deployed between the client and Elasticsearch or OpenSearch. Therefore, the gateway can be configured to perform index-level traffic control and throttling, cache acceleration for common queries, query request audit, and dynamic modification of query results.

## Before creating a new issue

* **This tracker is for issues with the INFINI Gateway only.**

* Search for the issue [here](https://github.com/infinilabs/gateway/search?q=&type=Issues) to check if it was already reported. You may use labels for filtering the [issue list](https://github.com/infinilabs/gateway/issues) by clicking any of these related to the problem you want to report or request.

## Filing a bug

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.
*   Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, giving an idea of what the issue is about.
*   Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.
    Be sure to include the following information:
    * Operating System
    * The version of INFINI Gateway that you're using
    * Any related configuration which may cause gateway to act strangely

    Also keep in mind to clearly separate fact from speculation.
*   Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. It might be useful to include a *configuration example* for this.
*   Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

We won't slaughter you if you can't fulfill all of these steps, but prepare to answer a few questions if we think we're lacking information.

If you want to be really good at reporting bugs, you can also read [these guidelines](https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-5.0-branch/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html) for bugzilla bugs.

## Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
*   Explain briefly what the enhancement is and why you think it would be useful.
*   Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behavior as opposed to something entirely new.
